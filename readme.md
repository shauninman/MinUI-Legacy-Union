# About the Union Project

Union is the sequel to MinUI. A custom launcher with a consistent, simple UI across all supported emulators that supports multiple devices from the same SD card. Share your library and save data (but not save states) with a handful of devices. Trimui on the bus. RG350 on the couch. I don't know, seems cool to me.

The currently in development platforms are Trimui/A66 (where MinUI was born), OpenDingux beta on the RS-90, stock OpenDingux on the 320x240 RG350/280 family of devices, and RetroFW on the RG300.
